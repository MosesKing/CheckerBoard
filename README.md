# CheckerBoard
Description: Create a Checkerboard class that generates a board in the style of the game of checkers in JavaFX using an AnchorPane as the container for the Rectangles that make up the rectangles on the board. Place the AnchorPane containing the checkerboard in a UI built in FXML that has menus to select the grid size and color scheme. Allow the Stage (window) size to be changed by the user causing the size of the board to change with the size of the Stage.
Purpose: This challenge provides experience in building a class to generate a JavaFX UI. It provides experience with JavaFX UI hierarchies and in creating an algorithm to generate the checkerboard layout.
